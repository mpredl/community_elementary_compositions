# Community elementary compositions

This is an example for calculating elementary compositions (eCs) in community metabolic models. Elementary compositions are non-decomposable vectors of community compositions - in essence the boundaries of the feasible community composition space. More information on eCs and other elementary objects in community metabolic models can be found in our manuscript [Elementary vectors reveal minimal interactions in microbial communities](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.30.667663 )


The example is a community of two genome-scale metabolic models an archaeon and a bacterium from the human gut microbiome.
The models were automatically reconstructed using gapseq (see [Zimmermann et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02295-1)), based on genome sequencing data:
 - M. smithii: [ABYW00000000.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ABYW00000000.1/)
 - B. thetaiotaomicron [NC_004663.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004663.1)

A full description of the model reconstruction can be found in [Duller et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52037-7)

The generation of the community metabolic model and much of the analsysis is done using [PyCoMo](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae153).
